      <h1>The fish</h1>
      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>A <strong>fish</strong> is not a fish when you are talking to it. Let me explain...</p>
      <p>It all starts when I was riding my biycicle near the river where I used to live when I was a kid. To be honest, neither the
        name of the city nor the river matters! But let's say that it was not far from where I am now.</p>
      <p><i>"This makes no sense."</i> You may <del>say</del> think. And <u>I </u> totally agree with you.
